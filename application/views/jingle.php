                                If the app targets members of a specific industry, using industry jargon may be welcome if used correctly. Depending on users direct language or humour may or may not be appropriate. A more common one (in North America) is knowing to what level the app needs to support non-english speaking users. 

                                Communication also happens visually. Different users respond differently to illustration styles, colours, use of animations, or interface complexity. Communicating effectively based on user preferences is good for its own sake but also because it builds trust which helps your app deliver more value more quickly.
                                
                                Example:
                                
                                Through user research we learned youth do not like to repeat their problems and find it easier to write down than tell a stranger directly. Repeating themselves can also be traumatic. In one virtual care app we created a feature for the youth to explain who they are and maybe some things that trouble them. This has to be read by the service provider prior to engaging with the youth so they do not have to explain themselves twice.
